# Geomasking Tool 

The geomasking tool was developed by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) Program with funding administered through Health Research Incorporated. 

The geomasking tool is still in development and is being converted to an R package.
