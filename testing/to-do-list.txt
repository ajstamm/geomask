* revise log to remove need to input area
    * requires adding projection to "mysettings" list
* add check for OS type to bypass Windows requirement in locate and save steps
* add way to bypass dialog entirely?
* add way to load layers in advance, rather than requiring shapefiles?
* add way to handle shifting polygons?
    * calculate and shift centroid, then add difference to indices
    * would guarantee only centroid is within buffer, not full area
    * when use case is unknown, forcing full area within buffer seems unnecessarily complicated
* Gwen's note had suggested shifting lines, too - should work like polygons
