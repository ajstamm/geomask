  Field names:        STATEFP, ANSICODE, POINTID,  
  Identifier:         POINTID

  Boundary variable:  GEOID10

Masking settings:     
  Minimum distance:   1,000 meters 
  Minimum distance:   5,000 meters

  Aggregated shapefile: geomasked_points.shp 
    Variables created by GAT: 
        point_id: duplicate of original locations identifier, POINTID 
        bound_id: duplicate of boundaries identifier, GEOID10 
        orig_lat: original location latitude 
        orig_lon: original location longitude 
        mask_lat: shifted location latitude 
        mask_lon: shifted location longitude 
        flag:     number corresponds to the number of times boundaries  
                  had to be recalculated to create a valid area to  
                  select a masking point using the equation 
                    new maximum value = prior minimum value 
                    new minimum value = half of prior minimum value 
                  e.g. flag = 2 means boundaries had to be recalculated twice
