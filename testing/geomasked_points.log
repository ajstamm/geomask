  Projection:         +proj=longlat +datum=NAD83 +no_defs 
  Field names:        STATEFP10, COUNTYFP10, TRACTCE10, GEOID10, NAME10, NAMELSAD10,

  Identifier:         POINTID 
  Boundary file:      C:/Users/ajstamm/Documents/GitHub/Coding/master/geomask/tracts 
  Boundary variable:  GEOID10 
Output file:

Masking settings:     
  Minimum distance:   100 meters 
  Minimum distance:   1,000 meters

  Aggregated shapefile: geomasked_points.shp 
    Variables created by GAT: 
        point_id: duplicate of original locations identifier, POINTID 
        bound_id: duplicate of boundaries identifier, GEOID10 
        orig_lat: original location latitude 
        orig_lon: original location longitude 
        mask_lat: shifted location latitude 
        mask_lon: shifted location longitude 
        flag:     number corresponds to the number of times boundaries  
                  had to be recalculated to create a valid area to  
                  select a masking point using the equation 
                    new maximum value = prior minimum value 
                    new minimum value = half of prior minimum value 
                  e.g. flag = 2 means boundaries had to be recalculated twice
